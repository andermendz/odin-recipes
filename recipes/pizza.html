            <h2>Steps</h2>

        
            <ol style="list-style-position: inside">
                <li><br>
                Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.
                </li><br>

                <li><br>
                Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl.<br>
                 Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam,<br>
                  about 5 minutes.
                </li><br>

                <li><br>
                Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain.<br>
                 Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.<br>
                  When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly
                   floured surface and kneadd<br> until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
                </li><br>

                <li><br>
                Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light<br>
                cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume,<br>
                about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.    
                </li><br>

                <li><br>
                Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).    
                </li><br>

                <li><br>
                Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a <br>
                lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of<br>
                the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5<br>
                basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea<br>
                salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.       
                </li><br>

                <li><br>
                Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven.<br>
                Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden<br>
                brown, 5 to 7 minutes.    
                </li><br>
